**FXBot** is just as you guessed- a **Forex trading bot!** It's been developed in Python, enabled by the OANDA V20 API.

This trading bot allows users to **backtest** and **analyze** their favorite strategies executed on the most popular currency pairs, while also enabling the users to dive right into trading these forex pairs in **real time, through algorithmic live trading.**

As we all know, algorithmic trading is the **future of finance**. When looking at the top trading firms in the world, all of them are making a shift towards automated trading, investing heavily in the space. The ones who don't automate, are at risk of falling behind of their competitors!

That's what inspired me to make this bot, and to expose to the public how really anyone this day and age can jump head first into the algorithmic trading world.

## Disclaimer

Before downloading and using this bot, please make sure to understand the following:

Through OANDA, you do NOT need to trade real money, and the same is true with respect to using this bot. OANDA.ca offers practice accounts, which this bot is **highly recommended** to utilize.

If you do decide to trade real money, this disclaimer is for you.

### Understand The Risk
Trading Forex involves a risk of loss. Please consider carefully if such trading is appropriate for you. Past performance is not indicative of future results. FXBot has been created soley for educational purposes only and do not constitute investment recommendations or advice, and I strongly recommend that you **use this bot as a learning tool.**

If you are to trade using this bot, understand that algorithmic trading involves a high level of risk and is not appropriate for everyone. No guarentee is being made that by using this bot, the algorithmic trading strategies will result in profitable trading or be free of risk of loss. There is a possibility that you could lose some or all of your investment.
